      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        I've been interested in programming since I was 11 years old, when I
        started writing Minecraft plugins. Since then, I've worked on a variety
        of projects that helped me build experience across different languages,
        frameworks, and tools. I enjoy learning new technologies and
        experimenting with ideas, and I take pride in writing code that's
        efficient, readable, and reliable. My projects vary in purpose and scope
        but share a focus on solving real problems through thoughtful design and
        implementation.
