      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Mihir. I live in Boston, MA, and I am a freshman at
        Northeastern University. My interests include artificial intelligence,
        machine learning, robotics, and data science, along with passions for
        web development, physics, and astronomy. With a deep interest in
        technology and its potential to solve complex problems, I am eager to
        explore innovative ways to contribute to these ever-evolving fields.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I am a student at Northeastern University, enrolled in the Khoury
        College of Computer Sciences and the John Martinson Honors Program.
        Currently in the second semester of my first year, I am pursuing a
        degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial
        Intelligence and a minor in Mathematics. I maintain a 4.0 GPA while
        managing a rigorous course schedule that challenges and inspires me to
        grow as a computer scientist.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        I wrote and published my first program at 11 years old. Since then, I've
        spent a considerable amount of time over the years working on several
        projects, developing skills in various areas of programming and
        development. I find excitement in learning new languages, new
        frameworks, and new tools â€” I love to experiment. I am passionate about
        writing elegant, fast, and maintainable code. My programs span a range
        of purposes and technologies but share a commitment to tackling
        meaningful challenges.
