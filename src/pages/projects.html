{% set shotClockReadMore %}
<p>
  The app was built using React Native and the Expo framework, streamlining the
  development and deployment process. This was my first time diving into React,
  and learning about the concepts of state management and component lifecycles.
</p>
<p>
  Considering the target audience may be impaired, I focused on creating a
  simple, user-friendly UI. User inputs are stored asynchronously on-device to
  ensure both security and simplicity. For calculating blood alcohol content, I
  leveraged scientific literature on the Widmark equations, ensuring accurate
  BAC range estimates based on several specific parameters.

<p>
  The program starts by querying and downloading data from an astronomical
  database based on user-set parameters. It took significant effort to
  understand the specifications of the data as documentation was sparse.
  Afterward, I processed the data using Pandas, NumPy, and a proprietary
  analysis package called CIAO. The data was then plotted with Matplotlib and
  exported to a web format. While developing, I put a focus on real-time
  logging, progress reporting, and crash reporting, so anyone could see why and
  where the program had any issues.
</p>
<p>
  This was my first project where I utilized parallel computing. Using Python's
  various parallelism systems I implemented a system that could download and
  process astronomical sources several at a time. Along the way I learned about
  resource contention, mutexes, race-conditions, the GIL, and more. The result
  was a program that was extremely quick, many times faster than a
  single-threaded one would be.
</p>
<p>
  I then made it interactive, allowing the data to be re-binned with different
  time durations. This allowed for data to be examined further, making it more
  useful for analysis. This was done by making a server that could host the
  output, allowing it to send a request to run a source through the pipeline
  again. See it in action below.

circuitCreatorReadMore %}
<p>
  This program was my first experience with Python web apps. I chose Flask over
  other frameworks because it is lightweight and proved easy to learn. I also
  learned how to use Jinja, a templating engine for Python, to generate dynamic
  HTML pages. I used JavaScript to create the interactive UI and to send data to
  the server. I used CSS for the layout and style.
</p>
<p>
  To effectively store and manage circuit data within the app, I needed a
  structure capable of handling configurations of series and parallel items and
  their permutations. To address this challenge, I designed a recursive
  structure represented as JSON that can represent circuits with variable
  complexity, ensuring I could represent diverse circuit designs.

<p>
  The project was built using WPILib, the standard library for FRC robotics, and
  the AdvantageKit framework for advanced logging and diagnostics.
</p>
<p>
  The drivetrain can perform autonomous path following via a sophisticated
  odometry system. The robotic arm, featuring two degrees of freedom, is
  controlled by high-frequency motion profiles and a feedforward control model.
  This approach accounted for system dynamics, allowing the arm to reach target
  positions quickly and accurately.
</p>
<p>
  Vision-based localization was achieved using two high-resolution global
  shutter cameras connected to a Raspberry Pi running PhotonVision, an
  open-source localization framework. Through meticulous calibration, the system
  achieved a stationary accuracy of within two inches. My custom filtering
  algorithm maintained usable localization data even during high-speed motion.
</p>
<p>
  The program leverages both built-in simulation tools from the libraries I used
  and custom solutions I developed. These high-fidelity simulations allowed for
  rapid testing and iteration in a safe environment, minimizing risks and
  optimizing performance before deploying the code to physical hardware.

<p>
  I chose Eleventy as my static site generator. It allowed me to streamline the
  development process using templating while still compiling to only pure HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an extremely fast site.
</p>
<p>
  Creating an intuitive user experience was a top priority. I utilized media
  queries to ensure the site looked great across a wide range of screen sizes.
  Additionally, I carefully designed the interface to look its best in both
  light and dark themes. I used Google's Lighthouse tool to audit my site,
  making sure it was fast, adhered to best practices, and was optimized for SEO.
</p>
<p>
  This project was also my first experience with deployment. I hosted the site
  using Cloudflare Pages, leveraging Cloudflare's CDN for reliable performance
  and uptime. I utilized additional tools like Cloudflare Fonts to enhance
  optimization. I configured GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy
  the site whenever changes were pushed to GitHub.
