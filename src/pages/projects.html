<p>
  This program was my first experience with Python web apps. I chose Flask over
  other frameworks because it is lightweight and proved easy to learn. I also
  learned how to use Jinja, a templating engine for Python, to generate dynamic
  HTML pages. I used JavaScript to create the interactive UI and to send data to
  the server. I used CSS for the layout and style.
</p>
<p>
  To effectively store and manage circuit data within the app, I needed a
  structure capable of handling configurations of series and parallel items and
  their permutations. To address this challenge, I designed a recursive
  structure represented as JSON that can represent circuits with variable
  complexity, ensuring I could represent diverse circuit designs.
